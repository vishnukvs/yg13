          <h2>About Yogathon</h2>
         <p>Yogathon, an <strong>Art of Living </strong>initiative, promotes awareness of yoga and encourages its practice to bring about health and happiness.
		  This unique event, Yogathon Challenge,  has inspired millions of people to learn Sun Salutations and experience 
		  the benefits of performing many rounds in one session. The goal is to complete 108 sets (216 rounds),
		  although people are encouraged to respect their physical limits and only do as many as they can.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
		  <p><strong>Art of Living's vision</strong> is to create a stress and violence free society - this starts with yourself. 
			If 2013 is the year you break internal barriers, Yogathon Challenge will make you reach limits you thought you never could.
			You will gradually observe the stillness sweep your entire being as you practise this beautiful sequence in honour of the Sun! 
		All those who complete the full 216 rounds will receive a Gold Certificate and be inaugurated in the Melbourne Art of Living Yogathon Hall of Fame.

   <h2>Yogathon Supports</h2>
          <p>Community SEEDS is a non-profit organisation founded by young Australians to assist community-based projects in developing countries.
          SEEDS believes that the best way to change lives is to give people the education they need to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty. 
          All proceeds from the Yogathon will be donated to SEEDS education projects in Kenya &amp; Cambodia, providing opportunities for disadvantaged children and young people to access the education they deserve.
